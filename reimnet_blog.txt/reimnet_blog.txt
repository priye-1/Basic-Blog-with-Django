Reimnet Blog User Story

Reimnet blog is blogging platform for Reimnet employees. 
The blog will be used by employees to make daily posts. 
These posts will be accessible publicly. 
On accessing the blog, the initial page will display a list of all blog posts -
with the latest ones appearing first, 

while also allowing users to search for previous posts.

The page should not hold more than 10 posts at any given time. 
Each post will belong to, at least, one category.
Each category will have a color of its own.
Hence, readers can view posts that belong to a certain category.

Typically, each post must have a header image to attract a reader, 
and some sort of summary or say headline or like a preface of the post. 
Nevertheless, each post can contain both texts and images.

The author of a post should be as visible as possible, 
alongside the date the post was published and the categories it belongs to. 
We believe such information are necessary to the community.

We think each post should be as SEO-friendly as possible. 
We consider this blogging platform as a marketing tool,
hence should get as much search-engine rank visibility as possible.

From the employees end, one should be able to sort the posts by the author, 
date of publication, and category.

In order to avoid some PR disaster, 
it's mandatory we review each employees writeup before he/she can post it on the platform. 
Hence, the writer should be able to mark a post as draft until it's published.

Lastly, we think each employee/writer that appears on the blog should have a public 
accessible profile page that shows the blog posts made by that employee/writer.
